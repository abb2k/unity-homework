# The TazGFX effect: slime unleashed

### General info:

This game is a sideproject me and a friend of mine started a WHILE back to try and improve :)

I made the code, and my friend the sprites

### Things to know to play:
1. <font color="cyan">Starting the game</font> - click the 'continue' button to start the game
2. <font color="cyan">Movement</font> - use WASD to move, you can move only while in air
3. <font color="cyan">Interacting</font> - click E to interact (you can do this only with doors for now)
4. <font color="cyan">Basic attacking</font> - use your cursor to aim, and click left click to attack with your sword
5. <font color="cyan">Spin attack</font> - when on the ground, use space to use a spin attack
6. <font color="cyan">Dash</font> - when you reach the end of your jump you can click shift, and if timed correctly with will make you dash in the direction you are facing

### Things I polished:
- file organazation
- some file and variable names
- interaction stuff (added the interface for that)
- prefab fixes
- made whatever doesnt need to be public private
- more small stuff

### Things that still need improving:
- code organazation (yes its still bad) and clarification
- some badly designed systems
- collitions of player with walls (change walls completely probably)
- knockback inconsistencies
theres probably a lot more but yeah thats what i gathered from going back to this project after 2 years

i hope this is good enough :D and that the readme helped in any way :)
